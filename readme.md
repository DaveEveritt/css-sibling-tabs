# CSS bookmark-able highlighted tabs

See [live version here](https://daveeveritt.github.io/css-sibling-tabs/).

How to create single-page highlighted tabs with bookmarkable URLs (CSS), and optional in-section jump links to content within any tab (JS).

If you only need CSS tabs that can be bookmarked, these will work *without* JavaScript. For jump links to content within each tab, you need the Javascript which reads and uses the HTML `data-link` attributes.

All code is extensible, you can use fewer tabs or add more, and as many sub-sections as required.
